## 🚀 Project Description

At **Freel**, we believe in **freedom**. Freedom of life, freedom of choice, freedom for the freelancer. We aim to provide a service that facilitates and revolutionizes the way photographers conduct their lead generation. Our web-based application offers a unique platform for content creators to sign up and showcase their portfolio to a specific audience in a specific location.

🌐 Imagine it as...

A Google Maps for available photographers near you, but the difference is it can be anywhere in the world.


Users in need of a photographer can sign up and search for available photographers in their immediate surrounding. This benefits the user by allowing them to find and hire photographers at a moment's notice while viewing their work through their profile, which showcases the photographer's portfolio.

For photographers, our services are nothing shy of revolutionary. Now, content creators have the ability to travel the world and generate new business anywhere they are. Our location-based services allow well-known photographers to travel to the other side of the world, showcase their portfolio to users in that area, and create new business.

_Not only are photographers expanding their reach, but we also offer a booking system where photographers can show their availability and accept bookings right from the site._

Photographers can use our site as a portfolio showcase and even choose their own unique username for clients to search.

In short, Freel App is the ultimate platform for photographers to:

✅ Sign up
🌟 Upload and showcase their work
📅 Facilitate the booking process
🌍 Choose where they take their business


Unlike most freelancing websites, we allow photographers to find clients who can meet them in real life. At Freel, the photographer can travel the world and have reach to a whole new set of clients. We feature available photographers in your immediate area, wherever that may be.

In the future, we have plans to expand our reach to other types of local freelance services. We aim to create a marketplace where you can find local available services in your immediate area while allowing complete freedom to the creator.
