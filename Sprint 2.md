SPRINT2 FRONT-END

Features:

$ We added a sleek and intuitive top bar that includes profile information, settings, and an upload button. Additionally, we included our application's       logo for branding purposes.

$ To provide a better user experience, we created multiple pages for our application, including a homepage and a profile page.

$ To showcase dynamic content, we implemented a scrolling view component that fetches live images from a server. The images are displayed in a responsive     grid layout, making it easy for users to view and interact with them.

Tests:

$ To ensure that our scrolling view component was fetching images correctly, we implemented Cypress tests that simulate user behavior and validate that the images are being displayed properly.

$ We also created Cypress tests for our navigation buttons to ensure that users are being directed to the correct pages when clicking them.

Tested navigation and image fetching functionality, as well as the back button, for our web application.
